### 1. Analysis

#### 1.1 Job Board Component
The job board component was designed to provide comprehensive market insights through automated data collection from multiple sources.

##### Data Sources and Scraping Methods
Primary data sources included:
- CareerJet (https://www.careerjet.com.au/): Implemented using BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing, with specific XPath selectors for job details (/html/body/main/div/div/div/ul/li/article/div). The scraper handles pagination through URL parameters (?p=2) and implements rate limiting (2-second delay between requests).
- Seek (https://www.seek.com.au/): Utilized Selenium WebDriver for dynamic content loading, with custom wait conditions for job listings to appear. Implemented proxy rotation to avoid IP blocking.
- LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/): Used their official API with OAuth2 authentication for data extraction, focusing on job postings in the Australian market.

The scraping process involved:
1. Initial page load with proper headers and user agent rotation
2. HTML parsing using BeautifulSoup4 and XPath selectors
3. Data extraction with error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Rate limiting implementation (2-second delay between requests)
5. Data validation and cleaning before storage

##### Technical Implementation Details
1. CareerJet Scraper Implementation:
```python
class CareerJetScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = "https://www.careerjet.com.au/jobs"
        self.headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
        }
        self.max_retries = 3
        self.retry_delay = 2

    def scrape(self, max_pages=70):
        all_jobs = []
        for page in range(1, max_pages + 1):
            url = f"{self.base_url}&p={page}"
            try:
                response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers)
                jobs = self.parse_job_listing(response.text)
                if not jobs:
                    break
                all_jobs.extend(jobs)
                time.sleep(self.retry_delay)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error scraping page {page}: {e}")
                continue
        return all_jobs
```

2. Data Validation Process:
```python
def validate_job_data(job_data):
    required_fields = ['title', 'location', 'description']
    validation_errors = []
    
    # Check required fields
    for field in required_fields:
        if not job_data.get(field):
            validation_errors.append(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    
    # Validate data types and formats
    if job_data.get('salary'):
        if not isinstance(job_data['salary'], str):
            validation_errors.append("Salary must be a string")
    
    # Clean and normalize text fields
    for field in ['title', 'description']:
        if job_data.get(field):
            job_data[field] = clean_text(job_data[field])
    
    return validation_errors, job_data
```

3. Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:
```python
def scrape_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.text
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            logger.warning(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

##### Data Processing Pipeline
1. Text Cleaning:
   - Remove HTML tags and special characters
   - Normalize whitespace
   - Convert to consistent case format
   - Remove duplicate content

2. Data Enrichment:
   - Add timestamps for scraping
   - Generate unique identifiers
   - Categorize job types
   - Extract skills from descriptions

3. Quality Checks:
   - Validate required fields
   - Check for duplicate entries
   - Verify data consistency
   - Ensure proper formatting
